$WW,1$Sound is generated with $FG,2$I8$FG$ vals called $FG,2$ona$FG$'s, which are 88 piano key nums, with 0 as a rest.  See $LK,"Note2Ona",A="MN:Note2Ona"$() and $LK,"Ona2Freq",A="MN:Ona2Freq"$().  God does not want death screams, perhaps, because God has PTSD or soldiers have PTSD.  (Imagine wounded on battlefields.)  $FG,2$Ona$FG$'s will allow elegant wave files for export and will allow the creation of simple hardware over the next centuries.
