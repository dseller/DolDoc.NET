$WW,1$$FG,5$$TX+CX,"Upgrading TempleOS"$$FG$

To upgrade, you generally boot the new TempleOS CD/DVD, install on top of your drive, modify your files and set it to boot your new $FG,2$/Kernel.BIN.C$FG$ by executing $LK,"BootHDIns",A="MN:BootHDIns"$().  Often, your code will have to be modified to work with the new version.  See $LK,"Change Log",A="FI:::/Doc/ChgLog.DD"$.  You might have to boot an alternate drive or the CD and modify your code until it boots okay.

See the $LK,"Installing",A="FI:::/Doc/Install.DD"$ documentation.
