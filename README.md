# DolDoc.NET
A .NET port of Terry Davis' [‚úù] [TempleOS](http://www.templeos.org) DolDoc document formatting engine.

__This is still heavily under development!__

## Online Blazor proof of concept

You can find a proof of concept of the DolDoc.NET formatting engine [here](http://dseller.github.io). Please note that at the time of writing, user input is not yet implemented. Also note that because DolDoc.NET is heavily under development,
it is very unoptimized. This is extra apparent in the Blazor host.

## Screenshots

### New OpenGL-based version

This version is improved: it supports resolutions higher than 640x480, and it supports custom bitmap fonts, as can be seen below:

### Old Win32-based version
This version tries to stay true to DolDoc's origins; TempleOS.
